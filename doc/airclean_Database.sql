Indoor air quality testing and site evaluation available', 'Air Cleaner Professionals - FAQ', '<h2 style="margin-top: 25px">\r\n	General Questions</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	Do I need an air purifier?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	If you live in Beijing, the answer would be absolutely yes. And we&rsquo;re not just saying that because we sell them. Fumes from car exhausts and factories from the surrounding areas can take the air pollution to hazardous levels on many days. (See US Embassy site for pollution levels) Therefore opening windows to let the air in is out of the question. The only way to clean the air indoors is through an air purifier.<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	Who can an air purifier help?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	In Beijing, pretty much everyone. However, children, the elderly as well as people with allergies and respiratory issues are helped the most.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	Why should I buy an air purifier from you?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Air Purifiers are specialised products. It is best to purchase them from a professional who can advise you on how to use them most effectively.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	Where can I check the air pollution level?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	There are a few apps where you can check the pollution levels in Beijing. Go to the app store of your device and search for &ldquo;Beijing air quality&rdquo;. The US Embassy also provides a twitter feed every hour on air pollution levels.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	What does HEPA stand for and why is it important?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	High Efficiency Particulate Air. This is important because the air contains a lot of small particles which can be absorbed into the lungs. Our Air purifiers can filter out 99.8% of these particles thereby making the air very healthy for you to breathe.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	Do you offer consultancy in English?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Absolutely.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Questions about Purchase and delivery</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	How can I purchase a Blueair Purifier from you?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	You can either send us an email at <span style="color: #0099ff">info@aircleanerpros.com</span>&nbsp;or you may call us at <span style="color: #0066ff">13661143811</span>. We cannot do online purchases at this time.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	Can you help me select a model?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Yes we can! You can ask for a <a href="http://www.aircleanerpros.com/service_packages.php">Site Evaluation</a>&nbsp;and we&rsquo;ll come over and consult you on which models will suit your needs and how many you may need for your home or office.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	How long does a site evaluation take?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Usually a site evaluation takes about 30 mins or so.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	Do you charge for site evaluation?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Unfortunately because Beijing is so large and it takes a long time to go from place to place, we do charge a nominal fee of RMB 250 to do this. However, if you buy an air purifier from us, this fee will be waived.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	When can you deliver?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Typically we take 2-3 days to deliver. However, depending on the model and the demand at the time (due to the pollution level), it may take longer.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	Do you deliver outside Beijing?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	At this time, we do not deliver outside Beijing.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	Do you accept credit cards or bank cards?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	We are working on it, but at this time, we only accept cash.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	Do you have a return policy?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Within the first 7 days, you may exchange the air purifier for another one if there is any defect. Please also make sure you do not throw away the box within this time. We do not give refunds.<br />\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Questions about Products</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	Are the air purifiers loud?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	No. Blueair Purifiers run on HEPA silent technology. They are some of the quietest purifiers on the market running between 30 and 50 decibels. So you can sleep and work without knowing they&rsquo;re even there.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	Do they take up a lot of electricity?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Blueair Purifiers have the energy star certificate and cost as much to run as a light bulb.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	How do I know if the air purifiers work?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	We can do a <a href="http://www.aircleanerpros.com/service_packages.php" style="text-decoration: underline">demonstration</a> in your home or office and prove it to you</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	How often should I run my air purifier?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	You should run your air purifier 24 hours a day.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	On which setting should I run the purifier?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	It really depends on the pollution level that day. For Moderate pollution, you may run on low speed, for unhealthy pollution, on medium speed and for hazardous pollution on high speed.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	How many air purifiers do I need?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	That really depends on the size of your home or office. We have models for many different sized rooms. You can compare models <a href="http://www.aircleanerpros.com/compare.php">here</a>. Or you can call us for a <a href="http://www.aircleanerpros.com/service_packages.php">Site Evaluation</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	How long is the warrantee on the air purifiers?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	We stand by the quality of our products. The warrantee lasts for 5 years from the date of purchase for all models except the 203, which is 3 years<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	My air purifier doesn&rsquo;t work. What should I do?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	Give us a call and we&rsquo;ll send someone to collect it for repair</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<br />\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n	Questions about filters</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	How do I know when to change the filter?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	We will remind you by sending you a text message. Also, your purifier has a timer to change the filter and it will start to flash when the time comes. We will then deliver the filter to you on request.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	Is it complicated to change the filter?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	No, it&rsquo;s very easy and takes just 30 seconds.</p>\r\n<h3>\r\n	<br />\r\n	How often should I change the filters?</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n	For optimal use, you should change the filters every 6 months.</p>\r\n', '24551faq_img.jpg', 1),
